		<h2>Hi there, i'm about to serve you.</h2>
	</div>
	<h3 class="colorm">But before serving you, let me remind or inform you of the past.</h3>
</div>
	<div class="formex">
		<p>Due to invasion of new technology nowadays the human activities have been carried out easily, because it have made the easy access of services among the people in the world.</p>
		<h3>About the past.</h3>
		<p>Back in a day, the informations were stored using the paper methods, the methods caused duplication entries of detail. You can find that a single person's detail was recorded repeatedly.</p>
		<p>There was no backup of data using paper methods in case of any hazard occured such as fire and file decomposition, the data had been lost.</p>
		<p>Also human errors occured such as handwriting which caused undefined message of detail provided.</p>
		<p>If someone needed to find details of an individual, it was not an easy task. The larger the number of paper files in the room, the longer the time used to get the details which resulted to immediate mind exhaust.</p>
		<p>The people made unnecessary movements to where they needed to get services for example, the job seekers had to write a letter and made movements from their homes to deliver their letters to the places where they were appplying for.</p>
		<p>Generally, the works brought about unnecessary tiresome to workers. But nowadays it is different. The workers relax while doing their works because the website systems have simplified their activities.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="formex">
		<h3>How the website systems have simplied works.</h3>
	<p>Through website, people make job application to various organizations, institutions and companies by sending their details including curriculum vitae online and they recieve the results of their apllications in a very short period of time as the system has set to verify the job seeker details automatically.</p>
	<p>Also it does not allow duplicatrion entries of data. if one forgotten individual's inserted data is repeated, The entry access service is denied and the system will prompt a message that the individual already exists.</p>
</div>
<div class="formex">
	<h3>How website systems are secure</h3>
	<p>Firstly, the website system ensures the data confidentiality. It ensures that the detail is not accessed by unauthorized individual. Only relevant detail is accessed by individual in the system. One individual cannot access another person's details as long as they are related. For example teacher and student where teacher can accesss only details of his or her student. But he/she cannot access the details of another teacher's student. Also one student has to see his or her details not otherwise.</p>
	<p>Secondly, it ensures the data integrity. With the system integrity, only authorized individual will change, modify or update and delete the data. For example the student cannot update his or her own examination results. Only the teacher can update a student result but in a limited time. The teacher cannot update his or her own details, only employer can do so.</p>
	<p>Lastly, it ensures the data availability by only authorized individual whenever it is needed.</p>
